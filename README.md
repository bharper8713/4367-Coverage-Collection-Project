# 4367-Coverage-Collection-Project

.java files for our SE4367 Project

Team Members:
Adrian Dizon and Brenden Harper

Status:
Phase 1 is currently complete

Phase 2 Progress:

Our program currently prints out the local variable names for the test classes. We are unsure why it is printing those instead of those of the program under test

An example of our program output (done onto the joda-time project) is included to show that our program works and runs on joda-time

We worked together in person on the majority of this code, which is why the commits are mostly from my (Adrian's) github account.
